## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

during this project I have learned
some css and have struggled with the flex box
I have added some shadows combining box shadow and webkit filter drop shadow and found that really cool
fetching and rendering the rating data was pretty much straight forward and easy
I have learned a way to navigate between pages
